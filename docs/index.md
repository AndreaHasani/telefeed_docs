# Telefeed Overview

##About

This is a bot used forwarding messages
from one/multiple groups to others.
The way it does is by using your telegram account and
when a message (you have configured) comes,
it sees it and rewrites it to the channels you want.
You can edit the way the message looks, filter it,
delay and change words.
